                        We, Toys with a Purpose, are a non-profit organization dedicated to providing adapted toys and books so all children can play, learn, and grow. Our goal is to have an accessible lending library that is full of adapted toys and books for people of all abilities. Through Toys with a Purpose, we aim to create a lasting impact on the commonwealth of Kentucky. Additionally, this program serves as a platform to educate students from multiple levels about inclusion and accessibility through the process of adapting.
